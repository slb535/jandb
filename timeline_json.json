Following two previously unsuccessful laminectomies, the plaintiff has a third surgery, and suffers a stroke that leaves him a quadriplegic and a victim of an injury that immobilizes him. Margaret Unger represents the anesthesiologist at trial, while another firm represents the family practitioner. The anesthesiologist is sued for failing to recognize that a general anesthetic could cause such a stroke; for improperly positioning the patient’s head during surgery and for improperly extubating the patient, compounding the damage. The jury hears testimony for nine weeks before returning a not-guilty verdict against Johnson &amp; Bell’s client, but a general verdict of $18 million against the co-defendant family practitioner.",

The doctor feels the patient’s history is consistent with mononucleosis and orders a monospot test, which is positive. The plaintiff is advised to follow up in 2-3 days with his own physician and to return if worse. Thirteen days later, the plaintiff suffers cardiac and is resuscitated at a local hospital with a diagnosis of Addison’s Disease. The plaintiff seeks to hold the care center vicariously liable for the conduct of the acute care center doctor as its apparent agent, and for negligence of the nurse who took his history and blood pressure.

In this case, the plaintiff contends that her former divorce attorneys acted negligently in failing to complete discovery of her husband’s assets before the court-mandated discovery cutoff date.  The woman fires the firm before the discovery cutoff date and hires a successor counsel, but alleges that the firm’s failure resulted in her inability to identify and value her husband’s assets in his law firm.  This results in her being forced to settle for lesser amounts of property distribution and maintenance.  Messrs.
